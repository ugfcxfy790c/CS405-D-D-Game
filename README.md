# D&D Game for the CS405 Final Project

Developed by Mitchell Carson, Eli Orbach, and Han Yan

# Project Description:

 We will make a text-based dungeon crawler based off of D&D 5th Edition. The player will use text-based inputs to navigate 
 through a series of rooms and fight against randomly generated monsters. Each room will have one monster in it. The player 
 will have a small variety of weapons, which they can use to attack and deal damage to the monsters. The fighting system will 
 work just like D&D, with an initial attack check to determine if you hit the monster with your attack and a subsequent damage 
 check. Monsters will have resistances and vulnerabilities to different types of damage. The monsters will have their own means 
 of dealing damage. After defeating a monster, the player will be rewarded with items, weapons, or other boosts that will 
 increase their power, and this will be matched with increasing difficulty from the monster encounters. If we have time, we 
 will add more features (described in more detail below), such as spells, player classes, and a more set-in-stone progression
 system with a predetermined ending.

# Inspiration:

We were inspired by both Dungeons and Dragons and old text-based adventure games. We thought it would be interesting to combine
these aspects into what seems like a simple game but with complex mechanics hidden in its text outputs. 

# Feature List: 

## Must-have
 - player with health, resistances, and inventory which can be a few preset types
 - Enemies that can attack the player and be fought
 - Rooms with enemies, items, and special conditions
 - Weapons that the player can collect and level up
 - Items that give the player effects such as health or resistance
 - A text interface to control the game
## Add-ons
 - Rechargeable spells which either deal damage or assist the player in another way
 - Player classes which they choose at the start of the game. These classes provide resistances and special abilities
 - Predetermined progression system. Different sections of the dungeon which progress in difficulty and having different themes for enemies, eventually leading to a final fight and a victory condition.
